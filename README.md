# Rayan Trading Website

This is the official website for Rayan Trading, a vehicle sourcing and shipping company.

## Viewing the Website

This website is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Due to browser security restrictions, you cannot open the `index.html` file directly to view the site, as the shipment data will not load.

To view the website correctly, you need to run it through a local web server.

### Using Python's built-in server

If you have Python installed, you can use its simple built-in web server.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of this project.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    If you have Python 2, the command is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

This will allow you to browse the site and see the dynamic content, such as the shipment listings.

## Live Site

A live version of this website is hosted on GitHub Pages: https://riyanswat.github.io/Rayan-Khan/
